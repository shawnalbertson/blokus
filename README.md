This project was created as a way to learn about object oriented programming in
Python 3 as part of the class ENGR2510 Software Design taught at Olin College
of Engineering by Benjamin Hill.

Blockus_components.py and play_game.py work together to run a pygame
version of the board game Blokus. The game includes four players with the same
pieces and colors as a normal Blokus game, and will allow you to place pieces until
one player runs out of pieces.


## What libraries

To interact with play_game.py you will need to include the following libraries:

import numpy as np
import pygame
import time

## How to run the code

To run the code, edit the last line of play_game.py to enter your group's names
and the colors that each person wants. After that, running python play_game.py
in a terminal starts the game.
